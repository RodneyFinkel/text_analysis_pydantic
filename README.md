GROQ_API_KEY



Use Case: 3
Dataset: "Created a CSV with 50 diverse short messages covering all labels (see intent_test.csv)."
Handling ambiguous/not-fitting: "Prompt explicitly instructs 'Ambiguous' for unclear, 'Uncategorized' for unfit."
Confusion discussion: "Mismatches mostly on edge cases (e.g., vague complaints misclassified as technical)."
Qualitative: "Works well on direct product-related messages; limitation: prompt could be more robust with examples."
